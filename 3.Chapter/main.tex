\fancychapter{Deep learning}
\label{cap:chapter3}

\textit{In order to overcome the issues presented in the previous chapter, and to take advantage of the fact that we actually have labeled ground-truth paired recordings from the dataset of Neto et al., a different approach was tried. In this chapter is reported the attempt of employing recent techniques of supervised deep learning to perform automatic spike detection.}
